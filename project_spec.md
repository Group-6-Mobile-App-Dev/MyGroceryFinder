## App Overview

### Description 
Free-To-Play Finder is an app that pulls from the FreeToGame database, a compilation of every game that is available to play for completely free on PC. Our app takes this information and formats it in a way that allows users to easily scroll and browse for games that could interest them. Users are then able to refine their search for games based on any particular genre or publisher that they are interested in.

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Mobile:** This product experience's focal product is pc games that are free to play. Unlike PC's, mobile phones are almost always accessible and well, mobile. This makes searching for a pc game convenient and simple.
- **Story:** The value of this app is quite clear to the audience, given that many game stores are difficult to navigate and riddled with ads. Our app is simple and to the point, featuring only free-to-play games.
- **Market:** The market for this app would be quite large because pc games are vastly popular worldwide, and no-cost games are appealing to everyone. The audience of this app ranges from teens to adults who game.
- **Habit:** Our user would just consume our app to search for games; it would likely be something used periodically to search for a new game.
- **Scope:** It is a medium sized, technically challenging task given the API we need to use, but our goal is clear.
